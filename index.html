        <p><em>The Walking Dead</em> is an American horror drama television series developed by Frank Darabont. It is based on the comic book series of the same name by Robert Kirkman, Tony Moore, and Charlie Adlard.</p>
        
        <p>During the Amazing Arizona Comicon, <em>The Walking Dead</em> creator Robert Kirkman talked about some potential spoilers for the remainder of Season 4 and beyond. Of course, he refrained from giving away any specific big reveals like the fate of baby Judith, but he did offer some insight into such things as whether Rick’s group would ever leave Georgia and or if Negan will ever appear on the show.

        <p>In regards to the fate of baby Judith, Kirkman said, “There was a bloody car seat there. Maybe she’s dead. Maybe she’s not. We’ll have to see. Maybe somebody rescued her, and they had like a nosebleed. They were like, ‘Oh, my god, I’m ruining this car seat. I really need to take this with me, but ok, never mind. I hope Rick doesn’t see this. He’s going to think something terrible happened.’ That’s not what happened. We’ll find out February 9th.”</p>
